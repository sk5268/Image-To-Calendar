# Image-To-Calendar
Upload a timetable image and add your schedule to Google Calendar

# Background
We were given our semester time table in a piece of paper.
IN 2024 !! WHO ARE WE KIDDING ??

I spent a lot of time adding all those coures into google calendar.
It was time consuming and prone to errors.

So automated adding the courses to the calendar using Google Cloud APIs.
Now I just have to take a picture and upload it, the script will take care of the rest.
